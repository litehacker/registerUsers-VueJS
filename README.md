# VueJS Simple Registration Example

This project was a trial to meet with **Vue.js**. The webapp has 2 pages: *main* (for adding a user details) and *dashboard* (to list users). Users are collected and inserted to simple Express + Node server. VueJS library and necessary components are called as `<script>` inside the HTML files of the project.
